Previous studies have found that urbanization often decreases net primary production (NPP), an
important integrative measure of ecosystem functioning. In arid environments, however, urbanization
may boost productivity by introducing highly productive plant communities and weakening the coupling
of plant growth to naturally occurring cycles of water and nutrients. We tested these ideas by comparing
NPP estimated for natural and anthropogenic land covers in the Phoenix metropolitan region of USA
using MODIS NDVI data and a simpliﬁed parametric NPP model. Most anthropogenic land covers
exhibited higher production than the natural desert. Consequently, the combined urban and agricultural
areas contributed more to the regional primary production than the natural desert did in normal and dry
years, whereas this pattern was reversed in wet years. Primary production of this urban landscape was
only weakly correlated with rainfall, but strongly with socio-economic variables. Our productivity estimates agreed well with NPP predicted by a process-based ecosystem model for the area. Signiﬁcant
uncertainties, however, remain due to extremely high heterogeneity of urban vegetation. Nevertheless,
our results clearly show that urbanization may not only increase regional NPP and disrupt the coupling
between vegetation and precipitation, but also increase spatial heterogeneity of NPP in this arid region.

1. Introduction
Urban development has rapidly transformed landscapes and
profoundly altered biodiversity and ecosystem functioning from
local to global scales (Grimm et al., 2008; Pataki et al., 2006; Shen
et al., 2008). Urbanization is projected to continue to intensify
worldwide, and urban sustainability has become one of the most
pressing issues that face humanity today (Grimm et al., 2008; Wu,
2008). To develop sustainable urban landscapes, it is critically
important to understand the effects of urbanization on ecosystem
functioning – an area that has received relatively little research until
recently (Wu and David, 2002). This is particularly the case for
dryland areas that cover over 40% of the earth’s land surface (Warren
et al., 1996). Net primary production (NPP), the rate at which plant
biomass accumulates in an ecosystem, is a critically important
ecosystem process in both natural- and human-dominated
landscapes. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) has been
suggested as an integrative measure of ecosystem functioning (Lieth
and Whittaker, 1975; McNaughton et al., 1989), and as such it is a key

variable in assessing the effects of land use changes on ecosystem
conditions.
As the main source of greenhouse gases and other pollutants,
cities play an important role in the global carbon cycle (Grimm et al.,
2008; Pataki et al., 2006). Fossil fuel combustion and elevated soil
CO2 efﬂux in irrigated patches of desert cities like Phoenix, USA,
produce large amounts of CO2 (Koerner and Klopatek, 2002). Studies
in Phoenix have documented concentrations of near surface CO2 can
be three times higher in the urban core than in the outside desert
(Idso et al., 2002). But local and regional carbon sequestration by
desert vegetation and soil pools may not be adequate to offset the
CO2 increase, although the potential is still high (Lal, 2004). Wisely
irrigated vegetation in urban areas can mitigate the rise in CO2 by
accruing and storing carbon directly via photosynthesis or by
decreasing energy consumption via shading and evapotranspiration
(McPherson et al., 2005; Nowak and Crane, 2002). Quantiﬁcation of
primary productivity on broad spatial and long time scales, its gains
and losses due to urbanization, is critically important to our
understanding of regional carbon dynamics.
Traditional means of estimating ANPP by ground measurements
are laborious (Sala and Austin, 2000) and prone to uncertainties
when scaled up to large areas (Wu et al., 2006). Global and regional
estimates of ANPP can be now obtained from remotely sensed data
