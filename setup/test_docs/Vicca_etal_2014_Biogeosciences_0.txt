Abstract. As a key component of the carbon cycle, soil CO2
efﬂux (SCE) is being increasingly studied to improve our
mechanistic understanding of this important carbon ﬂux. Predicting ecosystem responses to climate change often depends
on extrapolation of current relationships between ecosystem
processes and their climatic drivers to conditions not yet experienced by the ecosystem. This raises the question of to
what extent these relationships remain unaltered beyond the
current climatic window for which observations are available to constrain the relationships. Here, we evaluate whether
current responses of SCE to ﬂuctuations in soil temperature
and soil water content can be used to predict SCE under altered rainfall patterns. Of the 58 experiments for which we
gathered SCE data, 20 were discarded because either too few
data were available or inconsistencies precluded their incorporation in the analyses. The 38 remaining experiments were
used to test the hypothesis that a model parameterized with
data from the control plots (using soil temperature and water content as predictor variables) could adequately predict
SCE measured in the manipulated treatment. Only for 7 of
these 38 experiments was this hypothesis rejected. Importantly, these were the experiments with the most reliable data
sets, i.e., those providing high-frequency measurements of
SCE. Regression tree analysis demonstrated that our hypothesis could be rejected only for experiments with measurement intervals of less than 11 days, and was not rejected for
any of the 24 experiments with larger measurement intervals.
