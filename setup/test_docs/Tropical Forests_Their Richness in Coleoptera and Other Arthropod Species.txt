THE COLEOPTERISTS BULLETIN 36(1), 1982 75 Table 1. Numbers of host-specific species per trophic group on Luehea seemannii (Figures from Erwin and Scott, 1980). % Host-specific # Host-specific Trophic group # Species (estimated) (estimated) Herbivores 682 20% 136.4 Predatores 296 5% 14.8 Fungivores 69 10% 6.9 Scavengers 96 5% 4.8 1,200+ 162.9 Therefore, Luehea carries an estimated load of 163 species of host-specific beetles, a rather conservative estimate of 13.5%. I regard the other 86.5% as transient species, merely resting or flying through Luehea trees. If one hectare has 70 such genereic-group tree species, there are 1 1,4 10 host-specific species of beetles per hectare, plus the remaining 1,038 species of transient beetles, for a total of 12,448 species of beetles per hectare of tropical forest canopy. Beetles make up an estimated 40% of all Arthropod species, therefore there are 31,120 species of Arthropods in the canopy of one hectare of tropical forest. Based on my own observation, I believe the canopy fauna to be at least twice as rich as the forest floor and composed of a different set of species for the most part, so I added 1/3 more to the canopy figure to arrive at a grand total of 41,389 species per hectare of scrubby seasonal forest in Panama! What will there be in a rich forest? I would hope someone will challenge these figures with more data. It should be noted that there are an estimated 50,000 species of tropical trees (R. Howard, via R. Eyde, pers. comm.). I suggested elsewhere (Erwin and Adis 1981) that tropical forest insect species, for the most part, are not highly vagile and have small distributions. If this is so, and using the same formula as above starting with 162 host-specific beetles/tree species then there are perhaps as many as 30,000,000 species of tropical arthropods, not 1.5 million!
