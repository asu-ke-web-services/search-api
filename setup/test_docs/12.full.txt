13Admittedly, this will often be impossible, as Profes-sor Diamond stressed in his concluding remarks, andit may not always be necessary. At the same time, thevalue to restorationists of detailed work with simpli-fied communities was underscored by Patricia Wernerof Michigan State. Distinguishing between proceduresor practical rules that may work in a given situation,and principles that can be applicable under varyingconditions, Werner stressed the need for mechanisticmodels of community dynamics- models that she saidcan be developed only through detailed, and even tosome extent reductionist, studies of species and theirinteractions. In this context, Werner said she sees anexperimental approach to restoration as an importantand exciting step toward making ecology a rigorous,predictive science.An intriguing aspect of the meeting was the way thesubject of restoration served to bring ecologists withdiverse interests together to focus their attention ona single subject, construed both as an urgent problemand an exciting intellectual challenge. The speakersrepresented a wide variety of approaches to ecologicalresearch. Many of them were unfamiliar with the workof other speakers, and several had previously had littleinterest in restoration itself. Nevertheless, the subjectseemed to draw them together, reinforcing the hopethat ecological healing might serve as a goal or evento some extent as an organizing principle for ecology.If nothing else, it might well be that, as is the casein medicine, the challenge of ecological healing willprove a useful way of establishing research priorities.The idea of restoration as an acid test of basic under-standing, for example, argues strongly for the idea thatrestoration is an important intellectual, as well as apractical challenge, and suggests that it might be use-ful in identifying the most urgent and crucial ecologi-cal questions. Something like this occurs in medicine,where healing is accepted as an organizing principle.And the willingness of participants at this symposiumto look past differences in viewpoint and approach toconsider what might be most relevant to restorationsuggests that this might be true of restoration ecologyas well.In general, I found the tone of the meeting to beimmensely encouraging, with lively interest on all sidesand a general sense of excitement at the emergence ofa new approach to ecological research-an approachthat might help unify the discipline and bring theoryand practice into a new and more intimate relationship.If the meeting was successful in bringing ecologiststogether to discuss a common challenge, it was per-haps less successful in bridging the gap between theoryand practice. For the most part, the presentationsstressed theory rather than practice, and in some casesthe link with practice was so abstract that practical pay-offs and applications were less than obvious.Nevertheless, numerous comments suggested thateven those most deeply involved in the more practicalaspects of restoration appreciated the more funda-mental work and the attempt to relate it to the prac-tical problems of restoration. Clearly, much moreneeds to be done in this area, and the meeting endedwith numerous suggestions for further meetings andworkshops, possibly dealing more specifically withselected practical problems, and perhaps held on anannual or biennial basis. This is a possibility we areconsidering seriously, and further suggestions are wel-come.The proceedings of the symposium will provide thebasis for a book now in preparation, and expected outsometime in 1986. The book will include papers basedon all the talks presented at the symposium itself, anda roughly equal number of additional invited papersselected to strengthen the treatment of the more prac-tical aspects of the subject of restoration. Those wish-ing to receive notice of the publication of this bookare welcome to contact the UW Arboretum office.Summaries of many of the poster sessions presentedduring the symposium appear in this issue of R&MN.William R.
