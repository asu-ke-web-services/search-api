Abstract
Plant growth can be limited by resource acquisition and defence against consumers, leading to contrasting
trade-off possibilities. The competition-defence hypothesis posits a trade-off between competitive ability
and defence against enemies (e.g. herbivores and pathogens). The growth-defence hypothesis suggests that
strong competitors for nutrients are also defended against enemies, at a cost to growth rate. We tested
these hypotheses using observations of 706 plant populations of over 500 species before and following
identical fertilisation and fencing treatments at 39 grassland sites worldwide. Strong positive covariance in
species responses to both treatments provided support for a growth-defence trade-off: populations that
increased with the removal of nutrient limitation (poor competitors) also increased following removal of
consumers. This result held globally across 4 years within plant life-history groups and within the majority
of individual sites. Thus, a growth-defence trade-off appears to be the norm, and mechanisms maintaining
grassland biodiversity may operate within this constraint.

Plants use different strategies to maximise ﬁtness in the face of limits to available resources and attack by consumers. Heterogeneity of
both resource supply and herbivory rates in ecological communities
may prevent convergence of plant strategies into a single optimal
combination (Grime 1977; Tilman 1982; Herms &amp; Mattson 1992;
Wise &amp; Abrahamson 2005). Plant strategies also reﬂect environmental pressures underlying the evolutionary history of existing taxa
(Coley et al. 1985; Herms &amp; Mattson 1992; Antonelli et al. 2011).
Plant life history includes variance in adaptive traits, such as competitive ability for limiting resources (tolerance of low-resource levels), ability to disperse into new habitats and resistance to or
tolerance of pathogens and herbivores. Predicting the constraints
on, and trade-offs among, these strategies remains an active area of
theoretical debate (Stamp 2003; Wright et al. 2004; Craine 2005;
Grime 2007; Tilman 2007; Wise &amp; Abrahamson 2007) and empirical
investigation (Siemens et al. 2002; Ridenour et al. 2008; Viola et al.
2010; Agrawal 2011; Kempel et al. 2011).

The hypothesis that defence against herbivory, inclusive of resistance and tolerance, is costly has been largely borne out by experimental work, establishing one axis of a potential trade-off (reviewed
in Bergelson &amp; Purrington 1996 and Strauss et al. 2002; Fine et al.
2006; see Siemens et al. 2002 for an exception). Yet, while documentation of among-species trade-offs with defensive investment
may be common and widespread (Kneitel &amp; Chase 2004), there is a
lack of generality in terms of which morphological traits or physiological processes are predicted to beneﬁt from lower investment in
defence. On one hand, increased investment in defence may come
at the cost of competitive ability (Baldwin &amp; Hamilton 2000; Chase
et al. 2002; Viola et al. 2010). Strategies promoting competitive success vary with environment, but superior competitors are often
those more thoroughly able to exploit a limiting resource, such as
soil nutrients, and which can persist at the lowest levels of availability of that resource (Tilman 1982). On the other hand, increased
investment in defence may result in reduced growth rate, leading to
differential investment into growth or defence by species based on
the environmental conditions experienced through evolutionary his-
