1240communities may develop near the inter-face between the ÒThree-Gorges LakeÓ andthe remnant forests, which can significant-
ly impact the island biotas and the regionallandscape. In addition, changes in land-use
patterns due to increased accessibility to
mountain tops, in terms of tourism and re-
settlement of local people, may have vari-
ous impacts on biodiversity. Aside from 
island biogeography, other perspectives of
biodiversity and fragmentation, including
neutral theory (20), metapopulation theory,self-organization of biotic communities,
and landscape ecology (1, 21), should beconsidered.Many hypotheses concerning fragmenta-tion effects and biota relaxation require em-
pirical data over decades or centuries (7, 8,22), so it is critical to establish long-termmonitoring programs with permanent field
sites. Meanwhile, rapid biodiversity loss
may occur immediately after ÒislandÓ for-
mation. For example, Barro Colorado
Island, the largest island in Lake Gatun
formed by damming the Chagres River in
1913, lost 45% of its breeding bird species
in less than 50 years (7). The study ofTerborgh et al. (6) in Lake Guri, created bydamming in 1986, showed that small islands
(<1 ha) lost 75% of their biological species
within only 15 years, and that all islands lost
their top predators within 4 years! A signif-icant portion of the top predators in most
small islands of TGRA may disappear at an
even faster pace because of higher humanpopulation pressure. Thus, initial field sur-
veys are essential to establish credible refer-ence conditions for future research. This is
especially true for species at higher trophic
levels because they usually are much more
sensitive to habitat fragmentation than those
at lower trophic levels (6, 23). One of the limitations with such naturalexperiments has been the lack of the base-line biological and land-use information be-
fore the habitat fragmentation. Such infor-
mation has been inferred from often incom-
plete museum collections and historical
records of the island biotas or their compa-
rable mainland sources (23). Although thefirst detailed survey was a decade after iso-lation for Barro Colorado Island and 4 years
later for Lake Guri, Chinese scientists have
already begun to compile past and current
ecological data for TGRA before the dam is
fully operational (16Ð18). The worldÕs largest dam is not only ademonstration of the mighty power of hu-
manity; it can and should become a unique
and rich source of information for under-
standing and conserving biodiversity and
ecosystem services. To take advantage of
this opportunity, international funding and
long-term collaborations are needed.References and Notes1.J.Wu,O.L.Loucks,Q. Rev.
