my role has been to ensure that the English is as idiomatic and appropriate as possible. The 2nd Gelman edition was the basic text used but Professor Walter has modified the order and inserted a number of short new passages. This hook, therefore, is a little closer to the 3rd German edition which is about to be published. It differs from the older German editions in one other respect, namely the plates. Owing to the unfortunate loss of Professor Walter's originals in the Second World War and the non-availability of some of the original blocks the number of plates is reduced. Although unfortunate it does not affect the basic arguments of the book which are its essence.
