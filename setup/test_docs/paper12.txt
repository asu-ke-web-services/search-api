explaining 60 or 56% of the variance. Nat- ural enemies in fragmented habitats are more likely to be lost than their phytophagous prey because population growth starts only after the successful establishment of prey populations, and populations will be smaller in small habitat islands. The result is that food chains should be shorter in small islands than in larger habitats (1 8). Small populations isolated by disturbed environments are characteristic features of the agricultural landscape. The time be- tween population crashes (determined by cutting of vegetation or ploughing) may often be shorter than the recovery time of natural enemies, especially when they prey on only one or two species (1 9). In such situations of local loss and recolonization, predator-prey systems and multitrophic cas- cade effects begin to depend on metapopu- lation processes (20), such that only mobile and abundant natural enemies can regulate actual or potential pests. In addition, release of dominant com- petitors from natural control may cause competitive exclusion of herbivores. Com- petition is a structuring factor in endopha- gous but not ectophagous insect communi- ties (2 I.), and as expected, we found com- petition to be important for the insects spatially restricted to the clover flower- heads. Extinction of weak competitors re- sulting from the release of dominant ones may be a further indirect consequence of reduced biocontrol. We conclude that habitat fragmentation affects natural enemies more than their phytophagous hosts. Fragmentation re- duced not only biodiversity but also the rate of predation or parasitism. The rate of parasitism is linked to the success of bio- control; habitat isolation can be expected to release herbivores from the control of predators or parasitoids. Accordingly, de- signs of the agricultural landscape that maintain habitat connectivity may contrib- ute to the biocontrol of potential or actual pests. REFERENCESANDNOTES J. M. Diamond and R. M.

Sticht, R. Frank, P. Rosch* Trans-activator (Tat) proteins regulate the transcription of lentiviral DNA in the host cell genome. These RNA binding proteins participate in the life cycle of all known lentiviruses, such as the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) or the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). The consensus RNA binding motifs [the trans-activation responsive element (TAR)] of HIV-1 as well as EIAV Tat proteins are well characterized. The structure of the 75-amino acid EIAV Tat protein in solution was determined by two- and three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance methods and molecular dynamics calculations. The protein structure exhibits a well-defined hydrophobic core of 15 amino acids that serves as a scaffold for two flexible domains corresponding to the NH,- and COOH-terminal regions. The core region is a strictly conserved sequence region among the known Tat proteins. The structural data can be used to explain several of the observed features of Tat proteins. Equine infectious anemia virus Tat protein is a monomeric protein of 75 amino acids (1). From sequence comparisons of lentivi- ral Tat proteins, it was concluded that immunodeficiencv virus Tat ~rotein se- quences are in geLeral subdivided into sev- eral regions: an NH,-terminal region, a Cys-rich region, a core region, a basic region, a Glu-rich region, and a COOH- D.

The Cys-rich region is thought to bind two ZnZ+ ions (3), and the basic region is involved in binding of the TAR RNA recognition sequence (4). The Cys-rich region and a sequence homologous to the HIV-1 Tat COOH-terminus are not present in the EIAV Tat protein. The highly conserved core region encompasses amino acids Tyr35 through Tyr49 in EIAV Tat protein. In this study we used both chemically synthesized (5) and bacterially expressed protein (6). The nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) cross-peak pattern (Fig. 1) shows that the protein has a ten- dency to form weak helices from amino acid Alalo to Asn13 as well as through the core and basic regions (that is, amino acids His36
