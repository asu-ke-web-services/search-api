Values for sub- categories within a category sum to 100%, but a given paper may be represented in most major categories.

This survey generally supports the notion that landscape ecology is concerned with broad-scale features of land use and human landscape struc- ture. Unfortunately, it also reinforces the impres- sion that landscape ecology is not a particularly quantitative discipline, nor is it much concerned with theory or the formalities of hypothesis-testing. Landscape ecology is increasingly relevant to such problems as habitat fragmentation (Saunders et al. 1991), reserve design (Shafer 1990), the mainte- nance of biological diversity (Hudson 1991), re- source management (Harris 1984), or sustainable development (World Commission on Environment and Development 1988). If it is to be applied in such arenas, landscape ecology must be rigorous: its em- pirical foundation must be quantitative rather than qualitative and its theoretical framework predictive rather than solely heuristic. To accomplish this does not require that the traditional emphasis of landscape ecology be abandoned, only that it be ex- panded to include investigations of a variety of or- ganisms and systems over a range of spatial scales and focus more on elaborating and testing formal propositions, especially through experimentation.
